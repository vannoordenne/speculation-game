# The Speculation Game - Digital Version

**Design for the future you fear.**

A digital tool for exploring the ethical implications of emerging technologies through speculative design workshops.

## Overview

The Speculation Game is an interactive card-based design exercise where participants combine technologies, target groups, funding models, problems, and strategies to create speculative systems. This digital version facilitates workshops in face-to-face, online, or hybrid environments.

Based on **CORE v2.0** of the physical card deck.

## Core Features

- **Draw cards**: Draw one card from each of the 5 core categories
- **Swap one**: Redraw a single card, or write your own blank card
- **Blank / custom cards**: Fill in your own technology, target, funding, problem, or strategy
- **Twist cards**: Optional sixth category when a combination feels too easy
- **Wizard flow**: Draw → Design → Build → Pitch → Reflect
- **Examples**: Browseable example concepts for inspiration
- **Responsive design**: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Card Categories

1. **Technology** (10): Wearable Technology, Ambient Surveillance, Smart Devices, AI, and more
2. **Target Group** (10): Children, Students, Workers, Older Adults, Patients, Citizens
3. **Funding Model** (10): Subscription, Advertising, Licensing, Marketplace Commission, and more
4. **Problem** (10): Learning Challenges, Safety Risks, Social Isolation, Information Overload
5. **Strategy** (10): Optimize, Monitor, Support, Protect, Influence, and more
6. **Twist** (10, optional): No Opt-Out, Black Box, Scoring, Function Creep, and more

## Workshop Integration

- Built-in step-by-step instructions and reflection questions
- Example concepts on the Examples page
- Physical prototyping step (paper, post-its, cardboard, markers)

## Usage Instructions

### For Facilitators
1. Open `index.html` or `game.html` in a web browser
2. Project the screen for group sessions, or share the link for remote play
3. Use **Draw cards** for a quick start
4. Use **Swap one** to redraw a card or let participants write their own
5. Guide the group through Design → Build → Pitch → Reflect

### For Participants
1. Draw the five core cards
2. Swap any card that feels impossible, or write your own
3. Design a speculative system from the combination
4. Build a rough physical prototype
5. Pitch the concept and reflect on consequences

## Educational Applications

### Learning Objectives
- Critical analysis of technology implications
- Ethical awareness of benefits and potential harms
- Systems thinking about technology, society, and economics
- Creative problem-solving with constraints
- Future literacy skills development

### Suitable For
- Design Education: Technology ethics, speculative design, human-centered design
- Technology Studies: Digital sociology, science and technology studies
- Business Education: Innovation ethics, technology entrepreneurship
- General Education: Digital literacy, critical thinking

## Customization

### Adding Cards
Edit the `cardData` object in `script.js`:

```javascript
technology: [
    {
        title: "Your New Technology",
        description: "Description of the technology, with a few concrete examples."
    }
]
```

### Styling
Modify `styles.css` for branding or accessibility needs.

### Translation
Copy lives mainly in `index.html`, `game.html`, `examples.html`, and `script.js`.

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server required for local use
- Internet connection only needed for fonts (optional)
- Compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Workshop Best Practices

### Preparation
- Test the tool on your presentation setup
- Prepare prototyping materials
- Review the Examples page
- Set clear time limits

### Facilitation
- Provide context about speculative design
- Demonstrate draw and swap (including write-your-own)
- Encourage exploratory thinking over realistic products
- Guide reflection using the built-in questions
- Document participant concepts

### Follow-up
- Facilitate concept sharing between groups
- Connect to real-world technology examples
- Discuss further exploration opportunities
